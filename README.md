# inSurely
inSurely helps you choose a health insurance plan from the marketplace by simulating likely total out of pocket costs. 

# About
I built this in 2014 when in my first year of grad school I wanted to choose a health plan on the Healthcare.gov exchange. So of course, I built a monte-carlo simulation of healthcare expenses and ran the numbers using the available plan data.  I guessed about how often I might get sick or go to the emergency room and about prescription needs, and the tool would show me an average total out of pocket cost and a histogram.  With that I made my choices

# UChicago App Challenge
Later that fall I and another student entered this into the UChicago App Challenge, where inSurely was one of 20 Phase I Winners out of the 121 entries.
